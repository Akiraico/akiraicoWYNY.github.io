            <h1>Rhetorical Analysis</h1>
            <p>   Through the bravery and persistence shown by her during her acceptance speech of the 1990 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, Aung San Suu Kyi's speech was delivered at a time where tensions between the common people and the government were ripe with disdain. By discussing the usage of violence and oppression by the government using comparison and contrasting, metaphors, and parallel structure,  she brought about inspiration to the Burmese people and their fight against such evils and tyranny.
            <p>   Aung Saan Suu Kyi's utilization of comparison and contrasting helps to give a sense of calling and urgency for the audience, captivating them. By comparing governments who govern on the rule of law and those who don't. Whereas without governance through rule of law, the â€œburden of upholding [the law] falls on the ordinary people''. Through this, Aung makes a stark comparison to Burma and to other countries which do not have equal and just enforcement of laws. At such a time in Burma's history, where the government keeps its citizens in poverty and uses violence against their citizens for their basic rights, the speech is a beacon of hope for the protesters to continue their protests and to aspire for a free and democratic government. Even through her stark comparison, Aung was able to demonstrate the necessity for the Burmese people to take action and protest against their tyrannical government.</p>
            <p>   Aung San Suu Kyi's use of metaphors helps the Burmese citizens realize and visualize how they are in fact not helpless in the situation that they are in. She compares the state that the people are in to "water in the cupped hands", but then goes on to say how they can also be splinters of glass in cupped hands. In this situation, the cupped hands represent the military and the water and splinters of glass represent the people. By using this metaphor, Suu Kyi conveys the message to the people that they can continue to live in fear and let the hands of the military take total control, which would represent the "water in the cupped hands". On the other hand, they can choose to be splinters of glass as they penetrate through the "hands" of the military and choose to not give up fighting until they achieve a democratic government. Suu Kyi portrays the message throughout her speech that it is fear that corrupts a person as opposed to power. Additionally, when a person is courageous, they can overcome corruption and fear. The metaphor used by Suu Kyi is effective because it inspired and encouraged the Burmese people to keep fighting for their rights as it put two different visualizations into their minds. It conveyed the idea that although the Burmese military is strong, the public has the potential to be much stronger if they choose to have courage and faith in themselves and each other.</p>
            <p>   Aung San Suu Kyi effectively uses parallel structure in her speech to show the audience that she understands how they feel and what could be holding them back from wanting to protest and fight for their rights. She explains how fear is the root cause of most of our problems in society, including  "fear of imprisonment, fear of torture, fear of death, fear of losing friends, family, property or means of livelihood, fear of poverty, fear of isolation, fear of failure".  By using parallel structure, she acknowledges the different situations and fears that individuals are facing. She also makes it more relatable and personable because everyone in the audience would be able to connect to at least one of the fears she listed, therefore, they might feel better understood. Ultimately, Suu Kyi says how it is ok to experience these fears, however, it is how one reacts to it that determines the outcome of a situation. Instead of living through fear, she explains how they should repeatedly refuse to have fear control their lives. By doing this, the citizens will then be able to gain the courage that they need to fight for the democracy they desire.</p>
            <p>   Aung San Suu Kyi implies throughout her speech that it is universally the understanding of mankind that the basis upon which human rights are granted, that it should be the right of the citizens to rise against the tyrannical oppression for a democracy and that unity and spirit are vital to the rise. Through her usage of comparison and contrasting, cause and effect, and Aristotle's appeals, she demonstrates the necessities of action and urgency of the situation to her audience, wishing them to continue on their fight for a free and democratic government.</p>
